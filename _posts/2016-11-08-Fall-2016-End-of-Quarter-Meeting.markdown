Fall Quarter 2016 is reaching its end at Western Washington University. Join The League of Vikings for its last official meeting of 2016!

**Notice on recurring club meets: Meetings will now take place on bi-weekly Fridays to make the most use of the CF 24/26 computer lab computers.**

**Our last meeting of the quarter will take place on November 18th a Friday, from 6 PM to 9 PM.**

More info on our Facebook event [HERE](https://www.facebook.com/events/1155464474538171/)

Join us for 5v5 or 3v3 in-houses and forget about finals for a bit. We may even have enough interest to host a King of the Hill styled 1v1 tournament :)
